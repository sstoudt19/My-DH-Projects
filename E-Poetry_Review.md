# DH Project Review Essay: [I ❤️ E-Poetry](http://iloveepoetry.com)
By: Scott Stoudt

### Introduction
__I ❤️ E-Poetry__ is a website initially created by Dr. Leonardo Flores that that recieved 1st runner up honors in the 2012 DH Awards and has since evolved into the project that I will be observing in greater depth. In a nutshell this website is a platform for users to publish, read, and comment on various e-poetry. E-poetry in the words of Flores himself is, "a poetic practice made possible by digital media and technologies". To me, e-poetry is the way someone takes a standard idea of poetry and adds some level of technology to it to create a new, interactive, and engaging piece of poetry that can be interpreted in many traditional and non traditional ways. Below is a simple example of what e-poetry can encompass.

### Concept and Content


### Project Design
When considering the quality of the design choice, we must first answer the question, "What is the basic goal of this project?". I believe the goal of this site currently is to provide a platform for users of all interests, languages, and backgrounds to interact and engage with e-poetry. With this goal in mind, I can agree with the project creator in his choice in design. This blog post turned "e-poetry encyclopedia" is able to efficiently store, catalogue, and showcase user submitted e-poetry from around the world. The home page consists of personal posts from Flores and note worthy pieces he has recently examined. In addition to these recommended works, there is also a user-friendly index where you can search for e-poetry by name, author, and various categories. This particular system works for this project because it caters to people who have a sense of what exactly they are looking for and to those who just want to browse around a look at random pieces. This layout clearly was well thought out and the designer had a clear structure in mind when creating the website. The pieces displayed throughout the site are well spaced out and it is easy to navigate from poem to poem. The search feature is also easy to use and self explanitory, which is desireable to a consumer. Overall, the project's design is fitting for the clear and intended purpose of the creator.

### Collaboration and Documentation
As far as documentation goes, this project is a perfect example of what everyone should do when working on a project. In the section _About this Project_, the project's original publisher, editor, and writer, Leonardo Flores, lays out the entire timeline of the project. He begins with how the project started out as an independent project where he would read and respond to a piece of e-poetry daily with the goal of developing himself as a literary scholar and critic. He then discusses how the project evolved over time and he switch his blog to an interactive site where anyone can post, comment on, and discuss various forms of e-poetry from all around the world. 

Just like this project's documentation, the level of collaboration within this project is very impressive. As the scale of this project increased over the years, so did the amount of contributors on the site. At first it was just Flores, but as the scale of the project began to increase, he looked into expanding his team and recruited a board of advisors, dedicated contributors to the site, and even interns. The documentation process for the collaboration process is well constructed and each person who is apart of the team is properly displayed with links to their respective professional links as well as direct links to any individual contributions to the site. In addition to the formal members of the team, there is also countless users who interact with the site, whether they are posting their own poetry or commenting and critiquing others. These users are just as much collaborators as Flores and his team and as such, they are represented by name or username when they make a contribution.

### Final Thoughts
Overall, this project is an extremely well designed and executed DH project. It was exciting to see how the project started out before it exponentially grew over the years. Although, initially taking first runner-up in that year's DH awards competition, we must keep in mind how bare the project was at the start. If the project would have been submitted in the form it is in today, I have no doubt that it would easily take 1st place in its category. Initially designed to develop his own abilities as a professional in his field, it is amazing to see the site now repurposed to help others learn about the world of e-poetry and what a respectable DH project can look like.
